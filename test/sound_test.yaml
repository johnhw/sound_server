# Channel Groups    
# Each of the channel groups is a mixer channel. Multiple sounds can be mixed
# on a channel group.
# Each channel group has a gain, and can be filtered.
# Transient sounds _must_ be assigned to a channel group; the
# number of channels reserved for that groups transient sounds needs to
# be specified in the channel group specifcation.
# Channel groups can be attached to other channel groups, to form a hierarchy of mixers, using subgroups: [x,y,z]

# Sounds        
# Each sound has a name and filename
# A sound can be transient (played on demand) or not (played as background layer)
# The 3D position of the sound can be specified, along with the gain, a low-pass filter, and whether or not
# the sound loops. min_distance specifies the "scale" of the sound in world terms. A sound at exactly min_distance away
# has no gain attenuation at that level.
# The channel group this sound belongs to can be specified, which is mandatory for transient sounds
# Valid parameters for a sound:
# name: name of the sound (should be unique)
# min_distance: minimum distance at which sound is at full volume
# position: 3d position of sound
# file: filename of the wavefile (combined with base_path to find the actual file)
# channel_group: the channel_group mixer to play on
# gain: the initial gain

# Automations specify automatic adjustments to position, gain or filtering of
# sounds or channel groups. Once activated, these continuously modulate the
# assigned variables. For example, an automation can be used to whirl a sound round
# in circles
# Each automation has a name, a type (random, sine or spline), an attribute (gain, filter or position) and
# a specification for the specific type used. Any automation can also have a time block, which specifies
# another automation which will control the time rate of the original automation. e.g. a spline automation
# can be used to speed up and slow down a sine automation
